            <h2>Let's take some deep breaths...</h2>
            <p>If you're able to, please... 
                <ul>Move to a safe, quite area free of distractions</ul>
                <ul>Sit in a relaxed, position, preferably upright with your feet flat on the floor</ul>
                <ul>Try to be present in the moment and focus on relaxing</ul>
                Square breathing, also known as box breathing, is a simple relaxation technique that involves breathing in four equal steps.
                 You inhale through your nose for a count of four, hold the breath for four counts, exhale slowly through your mouth for four counts,
                  and then hold your breath again for four counts before repeating. This rhythmic breathing pattern helps calm the nervous system, 
                  reduce stress, and improve focus by promoting deep, mindful breaths. It's often used in meditation and stress management practices.
