# Kadence: An Interactive Breathing Guide

## Description
Our motivation for this project comes from the mental health crisis many of us face due to
everyday life and societal pressures. We built this project because we wanted to create an
application that encourages users to practice breathing exercises to help calm themselves
down, as well as give them resources to help aid them in their mental health journey.
We hope that this gives people a resource that not only helps them calm down, but allocates
resources to help find ways to receive therapy, and better understand their minds.
We learned how to collaboratively come up with a cohesive design for our webpage and make it
come to life with CSS, as well as add functionality to our webpage with javascript.
